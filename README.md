# Project---Skin-Mask
A simple feed-forward neural network to calculate skin masks for images.

The code used for neural network itself and masks post-treatment can be found out in the repository.

This was an exercise to develop a neural network from scratch. All the code for the network was done only using numpy library.

The file "Result presentation.pdf" contains the presentations of some tests and some explanation.
